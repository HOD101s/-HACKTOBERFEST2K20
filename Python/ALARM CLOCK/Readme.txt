...................About Code..........................


This is an interesting Command Line Interface (CLI) Python
 application for an intermediate-level developer. People 
across the globe use alarm clock features in their devices
 but this project can be altered in a bit different manner.
 Some certain YouTube links can be added to a text file and
 the project is programmed in a way that when a user sets an
 alarm then the code shall pick a random link from the video
 and will start playing the YouTube link.
